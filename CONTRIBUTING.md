### 4. Preview Changes and Submit Your PR

Click the **Preview changes** tab to review your updates. At the bottom, select 'Create a new branch for this commit', give your branch a descriptive name like `fix/matplotlib_version`, and click the green **Propose changes** button. Your PR is now submitted for review! 😃

### PR Best Practices

To ensure your work is integrated smoothly, please:

- ✅ Make sure your PR is **up-to-date** with the `ultralytics/yolov5` `master` branch. If your branch is behind, update it using the 'Update branch' button or by running `git pull` and `git merge master` locally.

- ✅ Ensure all YOLO Continuous Integration (CI) **checks are passing**.

- ✅ Limit your changes to the **minimum** required for your bug fix or feature.

## 🐛 Submitting a Bug Report

If you encounter an issue with YOLO, please submit a bug report!

To help us investigate, we need to be able to reproduce the problem. Follow these guidelines to provide what we need to get started:

When asking a question or reporting a bug, you'll get better help if you provide **code** that others can easily understand and use to **reproduce** the issue. This is known as a [minimum reproducible example](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum-reproducible-example/). Your code should be:

- ✅ **Minimal** – Use as little code as possible that still produces the issue
- ✅ **Complete** – Include all parts needed for someone else to reproduce the problem
- ✅ **Reproducible** – Test your code to ensure it actually reproduces the issue

Additionally, for [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) to assist you, your code should be:

- ✅ **Current** – Ensure your code is up-to-date with the latest [master branch](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master). Use `git pull` or `git clone` to get the latest version and confirm your issue hasn't already been fixed.
- ✅ **Unmodified** – The problem must be reproducible without any custom modifications to the repository. [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) does not provide support for custom code ⚠️.

If your issue meets these criteria, please close your current issue and open a new one using the 🐛 **Bug Report** [template](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/new/choose), including your [minimum reproducible example](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum-reproducible-example/) to help us diagnose your problem.

## Submitting a Bug Report 🐛

If you spot a problem with YOLOv5 please submit a Bug Report!

For us to start investigating a possible problem we need to be able to reproduce it ourselves first. We've created a few
short guidelines below to help users provide what we need in order to get started.

When asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide **code** that they can easily
understand and use to **reproduce** the problem. This is referred to by community members as creating
a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Your code that reproduces
the problem should be:

- ✅ **Minimal** – Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
- ✅ **Complete** – Provide **all** parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself
- ✅ **Reproducible** – Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem

In addition to the above requirements, for [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) to provide assistance your code
should be:

- ✅ **Current** – Verify that your code is up-to-date with current
  GitHub [master](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master), and if necessary `git pull` or `git clone` a new
  copy to ensure your problem has not already been resolved by previous commits.
- ✅ **Unmodified** – Your problem must be reproducible without any modifications to the codebase in this
  repository. [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) does not provide support for custom code ⚠️.

If you believe your problem meets all of the above criteria, please close this issue and raise a new one using the 🐛
**Bug Report** [template](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/new/choose) and providing
a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to help us better
understand and diagnose your problem.
