### PR recommendations

To allow your work to be integrated as seamlessly as possible, we advise you to:

- ✅ Verify your PR is **up-to-date** with `ultralytics/yolov5` `master` branch. If your PR is behind you can update
  your code by clicking the 'Update branch' button or by running `git pull` and `git merge master` locally.

- ✅ Verify all YOLOv5 Continuous Integration (CI) **checks are passing**.

- ✅ Reduce changes to the absolute **minimum** required for your bug fix or feature addition. _"It is not daily increase
  but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is."_  — Bruce Lee

## Submitting a Bug Report 🐛

If you spot a problem with YOLOv5 please submit a Bug Report!

For us to start investigating a possible problem we need to be able to reproduce it ourselves first. We've created a few
short guidelines below to help users provide what we need to get started.

When asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide **code** that they can easily
understand and use to **reproduce** the problem. This is referred to by community members as creating
a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Your code that reproduces
the problem should be:

- ✅ **Minimal** – Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
- ✅ **Complete** – Provide **all** parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself
- ✅ **Reproducible** – Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem

In addition to the above requirements, for [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) to provide assistance your code
should be:

- ✅ **Current** – Verify that your code is up-to-date with the current
  GitHub [master](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master), and if necessary `git pull` or `git clone` a new
  copy to ensure your problem has not already been resolved by previous commits.
- ✅ **Unmodified** – Your problem must be reproducible without any modifications to the codebase in this
  repository. [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) does not provide support for custom code ⚠️.

If you believe your problem meets all of the above criteria, please close this issue and raise a new one using the 🐛
**Bug Report** [template](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/new/choose) and provide
a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to help us better
understand and diagnose your problem.
