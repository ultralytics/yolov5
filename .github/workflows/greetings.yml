            👋 Hello @${{ github.actor }}, thank you for submitting a 🚀 PR! To allow your work to be integrated as seamlessly as possible, we advise you to:
            - ✅ Verify your PR is **up-to-date with origin/master.** If your PR is behind origin/master an automatic [GitHub actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/.github/workflows/rebase.yml) rebase may be attempted by including the /rebase command in a comment body, or by running the following code, replacing 'feature' with the name of your local branch:
            ```bash
            git remote add upstream https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
            git fetch upstream
            git checkout feature  # <----- replace 'feature' with local branch name
            git rebase upstream/master
            git push -u origin -f
            ```
            - ✅ Verify all Continuous Integration (CI) **checks are passing**.
            - ✅ Reduce changes to the absolute **minimum** required for your bug fix or feature addition. _"It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is."_  -Bruce Lee

            ## Status

            ![CI CPU testing](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/workflows/CI%20CPU%20testing/badge.svg)

            If this badge is green, all [YOLOv5 GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/actions) Continuous Integration (CI) tests are currently passing. CI tests verify correct operation of YOLOv5 training ([train.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/train.py)), testing ([test.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/test.py)), inference ([detect.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/detect.py)) and export ([export.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/models/export.py)) on MacOS, Windows, and Ubuntu every 24 hours and on every commit.
