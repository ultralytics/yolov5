            👋 Hello @${{ github.actor }}, thank you for your interest in YOLOv5 🚀! Please visit our ⭐️ [Tutorials](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/) to get started, where you can find quickstart guides for simple tasks like [Custom Data Training](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/tutorials/train_custom_data/) all the way to advanced concepts like [Hyperparameter Evolution](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/tutorials/hyperparameter_evolution/).

            If this is a 🐛 Bug Report, please provide a **minimum reproducible example** to help us debug it.

            If this is a custom training ❓ Question, please provide as much information as possible, including dataset image examples and training logs, and verify you are following our [Tips for Best Training Results](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/model-training-tips//).

            ## Requirements

            [**Python>=3.8.0**](https://www.python.org/) with all [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/requirements.txt) installed including [**PyTorch>=1.8**](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). To get started:
            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone
            cd yolov5
            pip install -r requirements.txt  # install
            ```
