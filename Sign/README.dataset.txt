# Use Cases

One could build a model that reads letters in sign language. For example, Roboflow user David Lee wrote about how he made the model demonstrated above in this [blog post](https://blog.roboflow.com/computer-vision-american-sign-language/)

# Using this Dataset

Use the `fork` button to copy this dataset to your own Roboflow account and export it with new preprocessing settings, or additional augmentations to make your model generalize better.
